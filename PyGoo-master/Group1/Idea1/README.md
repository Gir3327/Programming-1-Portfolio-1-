# Sleep Calculator - Which We Aren't Doing
The intended purpose of this project is to make a program that would allow the user to input their age and wakeup time. In return, the program would calculate the recommended and minimum sleep needed for the night, and would return to the user a few suggested bedtimes.

Suggested Roles (We're not sure at the moment):

Programming GUI - Tyler & Mikhail

Programmers and/or testing - Howard & Addison
